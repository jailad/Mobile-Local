<!-- Version History:
v6. final submitted
v5. stable  - pre-prod state, took care of all pending items, todos, and cleared out code
v4. stable - yql example gnews_4 - 1. re-architected the app to not use user's input directly, but, to first convert / attempt to convert the input into latitude and longitude in order to generate uniform results across multiple services. for example, when i input 'atlanta in' to google news, it does show to me news for atlanta in indianapolis, but when i enter 'atlanta in' to the weather service which I am using, it shows results for atlanta ga, thereby producing inconsistent results. also added some localstorage and localsearch functionality. also created onload function.
v3. stable - yql example gnews_3 - isolates js and css, better documentation, and better css. it is still about just the news.
v2. stable - yql example gnews_2 - isolates js and css, better documentation, and better css
v1. stable - yql example gnews

<!-- Features:

1. It will handle inputs like @@tlant@.
2. will accurately resolve aaaatlanta to the best match (atlanta, ga).
3. Will automatically load up the last valid entry open on the interface, when it loads.
4. always displays how recent the information fetched was.
5. When making a call to the services, it shows a nice animated loading image in the news and weather sections so that the user knows the app is responding.
6. if the location search box is empty, it is automatically filled with text - 'Please type a location here'.
7. Suppose I type atlantaaa in the search box, as soon as the app determines Atlanta, GA, USA, it will show as such within the app location input box, providing another feedback to the user.
8. The weather service which I used ( worldweatheronline ) doesnt seem to be handling City,State combination well. I tested with Atlanta, IN and it returns to me the results from Atlanta, GA. Thus, it would produce an inconsistent interface with google news which accepts Atlanta, IN. So, to resolve this, I first convert the input into lat, long for which the weather service provides good results.
9. Decent User Interface making use of gentle gradients.
10. Has the 'plumbing' for offlining built-in, but has not been fully implemented.

<!-- Issues:

1. While the app accurately stores unique key+value pairs for History, when I tried to convert it into links ( function $(".searchhistitem").each under mainjs.js ), I am unable to 'grab' the history item elements to manipulate them to be clickable links.
FYI: some of the other related functions which deal with history elements are:  savehistory() and displayhistory()
